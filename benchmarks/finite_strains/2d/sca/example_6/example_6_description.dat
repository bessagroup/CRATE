# Example:
#
# 2D plane-strain finite strains simulation of a 2-phase heterogeneous material
# characterized by randomly distributed circular particles
# (volume fraction = 30%) embedded in a matrix (volume fraction = 70%).
#
# The matrix material phase constitutive behavior is governed by a
# hyperelastic-based finite strain formulation of the von Mises isotropic
# elasto-plastic constitutive model with isotropic hardening, whereas the
# particle's material phase is governed by the Hencky isotropic hyperelastic
# constitutive model.
#
# The 2D heterogeneous material RVE is subjected to five different macro-scale
# strain-driven monotonic loading paths:
#
# - Simple shear
# - Uniaxial tension
# - Combined uniaxial tension - shear
#
# The micro-scale equilibrium problem is solved with the finite strain
# extension of the Self-Consistent Clustering Analysis (SCA) compatible with
# multiplicative kinematics, where the homogeneous (fictitious) reference
# material properties are estimated via the self-consistent scheme developed in
# the reference paper. This study showcases the accuracy of the SCA method
# under finite strains with a self-consistent approach. The results are
# compared with the solution obtained by means of the Finite Element Method
# (DNS solution).
