# Example:
#
# 3D finite strains simulation of a 2-phase heterogeneous material
# characterized by randomly distributed spherical particles
# (volume fraction = 20%) embedded in a matrix (volume fraction = 80%).
#
# The matrix material phase constitutive behavior is governed by the von Mises
# isotropic elasto-plastic constitutive model with isotropic hardening, whereas
# the particle's material phase is governed by the isotropic linear elastic
# constitutive model.
#
# The 3D heterogeneous material RVE is subjected to two different macro-scale
# strain and stress-driven monotonic loading paths:
#
# - Simple shear
# - Uniaxial tension
# - Combined uniaxial tension - shear
#
# The micro-scale equilibrium problem is solved with the finite strain
# extension of the Self-Consistent Clustering Analysis (SCA) compatible with
# multiplicative kinematics, where the homogeneous (fictitious) reference
# material properties are estimated via the self-consistent scheme developed in
# the reference paper. This study showcases the accuracy of the SCA method
# under finite strains with a self-consistent approach. The results are
# compared with the solution obtained by means of the Finite Element Method
# (DNS solution).
