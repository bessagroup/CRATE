# Example:
#
# 2D plane-strain infinitesimal strains simulation of a 2-phase heterogeneous
# material characterized by randomly distributed circular particles (volume
# fraction = 30%) embedded in a matrix (volume fraction = 70%).
#
# The matrix material phase constitutive behavior is governed by the von Mises
# isotropic elasto-plastic constitutive model with isotropic hardening, whereas
# the particle's material phase is governed by the isotropic linear elastic
# constitutive model.
#
# The 2D heterogeneous material RVE is subjected to a complex non-monotonic
# loading path comprising three loading subpaths under tension, shear and
# compression.
#
# The micro-scale equilibrium problem is solved with the Self-Consistent
# Clustering Analysis (SCA), considering CRVEs with a different number of
# clusters. The results are compared with the solution obtained by means of
# the Finite Element Method (DNS solution).
