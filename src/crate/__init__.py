"""CRATE (Clustering-based Nonlinear Analysis of Materials).

CRATE's is a Python program whose initial version (1.0.0) was originally
developed by Bernardo P. Ferreira in the context of his PhD Thesis
(see Ferreira (2022) [#]_). CRATE is devised to aid the design and development
of new materials by performing multi-scale nonlinear analyses of heterogeneous
materials through a suitable coupling between first-order computational
homogenization and clustering-based reduced-order modeling.
