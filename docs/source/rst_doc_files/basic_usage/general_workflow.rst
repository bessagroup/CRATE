General workflow
****************

Performing a multi-scale simulation with CRATE involves setting a **user-defined input data file**, which contains all the required data about the problem and the simulation procedure itself, and **running CRATE's main script**, which carries out all the simulation operations automatically.

The **general workflow of CRATE** in the solution of a micro-scale equilibrium problem entails **4 different steps** described as follows:
