Step 4: Post-processing
=======================

The fourth and final step consists in **post-processing the CRATE simulation results**.

CRATE generates **several output files** during execution time that are collectively stored in a **single output directory** created in the same path and sharing the same name as the input data file as shown below.

.. code-block::

    example_input_data_file.dat
    example_input_data_file/
    	├──── example_input_data_file.screen
    	├──── example_input_data_file.hres
    	├──── example_input_data_file.efftan
    	├──── example_rve.rgmsh
    	├──── offline_stage/
        │	├──── ...
    	│	├──── example_input_data_file.crve
    	│	└──── example_input_data_file_clusters.vti
    	└──── post_processing/
    		├──── example_input_data_file.pvd
    		└──── VTK/
    		       ├──── example_input_data_file_0.vti
    		       ├──── example_input_data_file_1.vti
    		       └──── ...


Among the **default output files**, three are particularly relevant:

* :code:`.screen` file - A **log file** where all the data displayed in the default standard output device is stored (usually the terminal console window, see :doc:`Step 3 <step3_simulation>`);

* :code:`.hres` file - A file where incremental macro-scale loading path data and the macro-scale material response are stored, namely the **homogenized strain and stress tensors** computed at every macro-scale loading increment;

* :code:`.efftan` file - A file where the RVE **effective material consistent tangent modulus** computed at every macro-scale loading increment is stored.

Besides the previous output files, two important **output subdirectories** are also created:

* :code:`VTK/` directory - This directory contains a collection of **VTK XML output files** (:code:`.vti`), each associated with a given macro-scale loading increment. These files allow the RVE relevant physical data to be conveniently analyzed with a suitable **visualization software** (e.g. `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_), as illustrated below. The **VTK collection file** (:code:`.pvd`) is simply an aggregation file that sets the sequence of the multiple time simulation steps and allows the generation of animations.

* :code:`offline_stage/` directory - This directory contains several files associated with the **offline-stage** of the clustering-based reduced-order method, i.e., with the computation of the CRVE (see :doc:`Conceptual framework <../getting_started/overview>`). Two files are particularly relevant:

    - :code:`.vti` file - A **VTK XML output file** that allows the CRVE to visualized with a suitable software (e.g. `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_), namely the material phases and the material clusters;

    - :code:`.crve` file - A numerical data file that stores the **CRVE structural data** (e.g., material clusters, cluster interaction tensors) computed in the offline-stage. This file can then be used to **perform multiple analyses of the same CRVE** (e.g., under different macro-scale loading conditions), while avoiding the computational cost of (repeating) the offline-stage. This option is automatically prompted to the user whenever the :code:`.crve` file is found within the :code:`offline_stage/` directory.
