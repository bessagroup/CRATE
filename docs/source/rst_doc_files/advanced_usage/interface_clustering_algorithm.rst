Interface: Clustering algorithm
===============================

Context
-------
One of the key ingredients of any clustering-based reduced-order model is the "compression" of the material RVE into a cluster-reduced RVE (CRVE) by means of a **clustering-based domain decomposition**, i.e., a cluster analysis that decomposes the spatial domain into a given number of material clusters. A material cluster can be defined as a group of domain points that exhibit some sort of similarity according to a given set of clustering features or attributes available at the point level. To take advantage of prior knowledge about such a similarity, the cluster analysis is **performed independently** for each material phase of the RVE.

.. note::
   For a fundamental background on clustering-based reduced-order modeling, the interested reader is referred to `Ferreira (2022) <http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.33940.17289>`_ (see Chapter 4 and Appendix C) and references therein.

To perform the cluster analysis of the RVE it is necessary to select (at least) one suitable **clustering algorithm** from the vast amount of algorithms available on the literature on unsupervised machine learning (e.g., `Aggarwal, C.C., and Reddy C.K. (2018) <https://www.google.com/books/edition/Data_Clustering/cH50DwAAQBAJ?>`_, `Gan et al. (2020) <https://www.google.com/books/edition/Data_Clustering_Theory_Algorithms_and_Ap/r4wIEAAAQBAJ?>`_). For instance, one well-known and widely applied centroid-based clustering algorithm is called K-Means clustering, for which several implementation algorithms can often be found in open-source libraries.

Therefore, given a particular application and the constitutive behavior of the RVE material phases, it may be of interest to implement new clustering algorithms that result in the definition of a more suitable CRVE. It is also worth noticing that there are several Python open-source libraries (e.g., `SciPy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.html>`_, `Scikit-Learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html>`_) that provide many ready-to-use implementations of well-established clustering algorithms.

Implementation steps
--------------------

The implementation of a **new clustering algorithm** in CRATE involves **five fundamental steps**:

* **Step 1** - Create a Python module with the name of the new clustering algorithm (e.g., :code:`new_clustering_algorithm.py`) in the directory :code:`crate.clustering.algorithms` (create directory if not existent);

* **Step 2** - In :code:`new_clustering_algorithm.py`, import the clustering algorithm interface (:py:class:`~crate.clustering.clusteringalgs.ClusteringAlgorithm`) and derive a class for the new clustering algorithm (e.g., :code:`NewClusteringAlgorithm`):

    .. code-block:: python

       # clustering.algorithms.new_clustering_algorithm.py

       from clustering.clusteringalgs import ClusteringAlgorithm

       class NewClusteringAlgorithm(ClusteringAlgorithm):
           """New clustering algorithm."""

* **Step 3** - In :py:mod:`crate.clustering.clusteringalgs`, check the already existent clustering algorithms (:py:attr:`~crate.clustering.clusteringalgs.ClusterAnalysis.available_clustering_alg`), choose a unique integer identifier :code:`id` for the new clustering algorithm and add it as a new item of :py:attr:`~crate.clustering.clusteringalgs.ClusterAnalysis.available_clustering_alg`:

    .. code-block:: python

       # clustering.clusteringalgs.py

       class ClusterAnalysis:
           """Interface to perform a cluster analysis."""

           available_clustering_alg = {'< id >': 'New clustering algorithm', }

* **Step 4** - In :py:mod:`crate.clustering.clusteringalgs`, import and add the initialization of the new clustering algorithm in the :py:meth:`~crate.clustering.clusteringals.ClusterAnalysis.get_fitted_estimator` method of class :py:class:`~crate.clustering.clusteringals.ClusterAnalysis`:

    .. code-block:: python
       :emphasize-lines: 3, 12-14

       # clustering.clusteringals.py

       from clustering.algorithms.new_clustering_algorithm import NewClusteringAlgorithm

       class ClusterAnalysis:
           """Interface to perform a cluster analysis."""

           def get_fitted_estimator(self, data_matrix, clust_alg_id, n_clusters):
               """Get cluster labels and clustering fitted estimator."""

               # Instantiate clustering algorithm
               if clust_alg_id == '< id >':
                   # Instantiate New Clustering Algorithm
                   clust_alg = NewClusteringAlgorithm()
               # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               else:
                   raise RuntimeError('Unknown clustering algorithm.')

* **Step 5** - Perform the complete implementation of the new clustering algorithm in :code:`new_clustering_algorithm.py` by developing the class :code:`NewClusteringAlgorithm` and implementing the abstract methods (look for the @abstractmethod decorator) established by the clustering algorithm interface (:py:class:`~crate.clustering.clusteringalgs.ClusteringAlgorithm`).

Recommendations
---------------

* If you are not familiar with the implementation of a clustering algorithm in CRATE, it is **recommended** that you first take a look into the implementation of the clustering algorithms already available (:py:mod:`crate.clustering.clusteringalgs`). Despite being embedded directly in :py:mod:`crate.clustering.clusteringalgs`, the fundamental implementation steps of these clustering algorithms follows the steps previously outlined and are fully documented;

* In the particular case of a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm and when access to the linkage matrix is required, derive a class for the new clustering algorithm (e.g., :code:`NewClusteringAlgorithm`) from the **hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm interface** (:py:class:`~crate.clustering.clusteringalgs.AgglomerativeAlgorithm`) instead;

* Take advantage of the several Python **open-source libraries** (e.g., `SciPy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.html>`_, `Scikit-Learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html>`_) that provide many well-established clustering algorithms and implement a simple **wrapper class** compliant with the clustering algorithm interface (:py:class:`~crate.clustering.clusteringalgs.ClusteringAlgorithm`).
