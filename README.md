### Summary
**CRATE** (Clustering-based Nonlinear Analysis of Materials) is a Python program developed in the context of computational mechanics to aid the design and development of new materials. Its main purpose is **performing multi-scale nonlinear analyses of heterogeneous materials** through a suitable coupling between first-order computational homogenization and clustering-based reduced-order modeling: given a representative volume element of the material microstructure and the corresponding material phase properties, CRATE computes the material's effective mechanical response when subject to a prescribed macro-scale loading path.

### Authorship & Citation
CRATE was originally developed by Bernardo P. Ferreira<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> in the context of his PhD Thesis<sup>[2](#f2)</sup>.

# Community Support

If you find any **issues**, **bugs** or **problems** with CRATE, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/bessagroup/CRATE/issues) to report them. Provide a clear description of the problem, as well as a complete report on the underlying details, so that it can be easily reproduced and (hopefully) fixed!

You are also welcome to post there any **questions**, **comments** or **suggestions** for improvement in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/bessagroup/CRATE/discussions) space!

>**Note:**  
>Bear in mind that CRATE is a program developed in an academic environment and that I'm currently the only developer as a side project. This means that I'll do my best to address all the issues, questions and suggestions, but do expect a reasonable time frame! ~ *Bernardo P. Ferreira*
