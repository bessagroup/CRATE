Benchmarks
==========

Summary
-------

`CRATE GitHub repository <https://github.com/bessagroup/CRATE>`_ includes a directory containing a **set of benchmarks** that illustrate the application of CRATE to perform different multi-scale simulations of heterogeneous materials.

Benchmarks are conveniently listed in :code:`benchmarks/benchmarks_list.dat` and are essentially classified according with:

* **Strain formulation**: Infinitesimal strains or Finite strains;
* **Problem type**: 2D (plain-strain) or 3D;
* **Solution method**: Any implemented clustering-based reduced-order method.

The module :code:`benchmarks/run_crate_benchmark.py` is made available to seamlessly test any of the listed benchmarks, performing a single simulation on the specified input data file (set under string object :py:attr:`benchmark_file`) by default.

.. note::

   This module may serve as the starting point to develop a more complex Python script that performs any number of CRATE simulations!

Benchmark
---------

**Each benchmark** directory includes:

* A :code:`description.dat` file that provides a **detailed description** of the associated simulation(s), namely covering (1) the problem type and strain formulation, (2) the heterogeneous material microstructure descriptors, (3) the material phases constitutive models, (4) the macro-scale loading paths, (5) the adopted clustering-based reduced-order method(s) and (6) other relevant benchmark-specific parameters. The **source** of the benchmark is also specified, i.e., if the benchmark is taken from the literature (e.g., scientific paper, thesis, technical report);

* A set of **input data file(s)** associated with the benchmark simulation(s), where each input data file header contains a detailed description of the particular simulation, similarly to the benchmark description file;

* A **set of graphical results** associated with the benchmark simulation(s), namely the homogenized stress-strain response of the material;

* If available (e.g., literature, third-party software), the results obtained with a high-fidelity **direct numerical simulation** (DNS) method are also provided for comparison and validation purposes.

.. note::
   To avoid exhausting the memory requirements of CRATE GitHub repository, the output directory of each benchmark simulation is **not** provided, i.e., must be generated by performing the corresponding simulation.
